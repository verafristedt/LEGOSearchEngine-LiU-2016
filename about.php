				<h1 class="aboutHeader">How to search</h1>
				<p class="aboutText">Choose either Parts or Sets from the tabs above the search box depending on what you are
					looking for. Then enter a part of a name or ID-number in order to get all Items containing the entered phrase.
					Remember that if you enter more than one word in the searchbox the words have to follow in chronoligical order
					of which the name/ID-number is written in the system. For example a part called "Arm holder brick 2 x 2 with hole"
					will not appear if "Arm brick" was searched, however "Arm holder" would work. When you have searched for an item,
					a list will appear with all Parts (or Sets depending on what you chose from the tab above) cointaining the entered
					keyword. You will be able to choose the product that you were looking for and get redirected to another page with
					information about the chosen product. Good luck with your search!</p>
