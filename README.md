# LEGO Search Engine

Project in the course "Electronic Publishing" (TNMK30) at LiU. A website where the user can search in a large LEGO database for parts or sets.

#### Final result
Final webpage can be found [here](http://www.student.itn.liu.se/~veran877/TNMK30/LEGO-projekt/flumindex.php). 

Enter e.g. "horse" in the search bar, then explore the results.
